When the "/" route is requested via GET, the web application should display, in a table, all of the people in the birthdays.db database along with their birthdays.

In app.py, add logic to the GET request handling the query to the birthdays.db database for all birthdays. Pass all of that data to the index.html template.

In index.html, add logic to render each birthday as a row in the table. Each row should have two columns: one column for the person’s name and another column for the person’s birthday.

When the "/" route is requested via POST, the web application should add a new birthday to the database and then re-render the index page.

In index.html, add an HTML form. The form should let users type in a name, a birthday month, and a birthday day. Be sure the form submits to "/" (its “action”) with a method of post.

In app.py, add logic to the POST request handling to INSERT a new row into the birthdays table based on the data supplied by the user.
